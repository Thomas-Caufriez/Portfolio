Doing this website was a bit hard to do at some points because, at the time I'm writing this, I don't have much knowledge in javascript and animations.

I still really enjoyed doing it and imaginating the univers around. I really like the vibe and the feelings that I put in it.

I did a lot of SEO on it too and tried to boost it as much as I can (I even used a bit of json for the first time) even though I don't know if the SEO works with a free github page.

I plan on buying a real host one day so it can show it's full potential.

I hope you understand my code and if you'd like to comment about it, feel free to send me an email or a message.
I'd be glad to get some feedbacks!
